## Our Mission

Unified UI was born from a simple observation: developers spend too much time rebuilding the same UI primitives instead of focusing on their core product.

To provide the most performant, accessible, and beautiful documentation and UI platform for modern engineering teams. We believe that great tools should be invisible—they should just work, allowing you to focus on what matters most.

## Our Values

Everything we build is guided by a core set of principles that ensure we never compromise on quality.

- **Precision**: We care about every pixel and every millisecond of performance.
- **Accessibility**: UI should be inclusive by default, not as an afterthought.
- **Openness**: We believe in the power of open-source and collaborative building.
- **Simplicity**: Complexity is easy; simplicity is hard. We strive for the latter.

## The Team

We are a remote-first team of designers and engineers passionate about building the next generation of web interfaces. Our diverse backgrounds help us see problems from multiple perspectives, leading to more robust solutions.
